    description: `
Infinity Guantler – The Snap has already happened — half the universe is gone, and chaos reigns. Fifteen teams of new Avengers embark on a daring mission: travel back in time to retrieve the six Infinity Stones before Thanos can claim them. Each round represents a journey to a different point in the past, testing strategy, skill, and teamwork. Rounds 1–4 (Space, Reality, Mind, Time) are point-based challenges where all teams compete, gaining strength and experience without any eliminations, preparing for the high-stakes battles ahead.

The adventure intensifies in the Power Stone round, where the bottom nine teams are snapped out, leaving six survivors to continue. In the Soul Stone challenge, each team must make a strategic sacrifice — a member sits out— shaping the outcome of the final round. Finally, in Endgame, the surviving six teams face chaos, dice-based twists, and unpredictable challenges as they race to collect all stones and defeat Thanos. Only one team will rise as the Infinity Champion, saving the universe and mastering the fate of the Infinity Stones.
