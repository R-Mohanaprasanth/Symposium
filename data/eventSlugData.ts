Bug Slayer is a high-intensity individual technical challenge designed to test a participant’s problem-solving ability, logical reasoning, and debugging expertise. In this event, candidates compete independently, relying solely on their analytical skills to identify, understand, and resolve bugs presented in unique problem scenarios.
What sets Bug Slayer apart is its emphasis on independent thinking and originality. Each participant is required to analyze the given code or logical flaw, trace errors systematically, and deliver an efficient, well-reasoned solution within a limited time frame. The event evaluates accuracy, clarity of approach, and depth of understanding rather than speed alone, ensuring a fair and skill-focused competition.

By simulating real-world debugging situations, Bug Slayer offers a practical platform for candidates to demonstrate technical competence, attention to detail, and decision-making under pressure—where every bug is a test of logic, and every solution reflects individual skill.
